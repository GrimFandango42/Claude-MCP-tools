# Final Server Removal List - WITH SCREENPILOT KEPT

## 🔴 SERVERS TO REMOVE (8 total)

### Code Intelligence Stubs (6 servers)
1. **code-analysis-mcp** - Stub only, duplicates Claude's abilities
2. **code-quality-mcp** - Stub only, redundant with formatter
3. **refactoring-mcp** - Stub only, edit tools sufficient
4. **test-intelligence-mcp** - Stub only, Claude writes tests well
5. **dependency-analysis-mcp** - Stub only, redundant with security-scanner
6. **code-intelligence-core** - Framework for servers we're removing

### Memory Consolidation (1 server)
7. **knowledge-memory-mcp** - Remove since you prefer simple key-value
   - Keep official `memory` server instead

### Desktop Automation Consolidation (1 server)
8. **claude-desktop-agent** - Basic screenshot only, fully covered by windows-computer-use

## 🟢 SERVERS TO KEEP (17 servers)

### Desktop Automation (3 - kept based on unique capabilities)
- ✅ **windows-computer-use** - Direct control, Computer Use API compliance
- ✅ **screenpilot** - Intelligent UI element detection and screen analysis
- ✅ **containerized-computer-use** - Secure/isolated automation

### Specialized Servers (ALL kept)
- ✅ n8n-mcp-server
- ✅ financial-mcp-server
- ✅ api-gateway-mcp
- ✅ vibetest-use
- ✅ fantasy-pl (if exists)

### Core Infrastructure
- ✅ filesystem
- ✅ github
- ✅ sqlite
- ✅ docker-orchestration-mcp
- ✅ memory (official)

### High-Value Integrations
- ✅ agenticseek-mcp
- ✅ playwright (web automation)
- ✅ firecrawl-mcp-custom
- ✅ claude-code-integration-mcp (needs fixing)
- ✅ sequential-thinking
- ✅ pandoc

## 🔧 ADDITIONAL ACTIONS

1. **Add 2 simple replacements**:
   - `code-formatter-mcp` - Simple formatter wrapper
   - `security-scanner-mcp` - Simple security scanner

2. **Fix claude-code-integration-mcp** errors

## 📊 FINAL COUNT
- **Current**: 25 servers
- **After changes**: 19 servers (removing 8, adding 2)
- **Net reduction**: 6 servers

## 💡 WHY KEEP SCREENPILOT

After analysis, ScreenPilot offers unique capabilities:
- **Element Detection**: Can find and interact with UI elements by appearance
- **Screen Analysis**: Understands what's on screen beyond raw pixels
- **Different Approach**: Works where coordinate-based automation might fail
- **Complementary**: Works well alongside windows-computer-use for different scenarios

## ⚠️ READY TO PROCEED?

This is the final plan based on your feedback:
1. Remove 8 servers (6 code stubs + 1 memory + 1 basic desktop tool)
2. Keep ScreenPilot for its unique UI analysis capabilities
3. Add 2 simple code tool replacements
4. Fix claude-code-integration-mcp
