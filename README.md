## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. MCP Server Connection Failed

**Symptoms:**
- Claude reports it cannot connect to the MCP server
- "Tool Not Available" error in Claude
- Server refuses connection

**Solutions:**
- Ensure the server is running (check process list)
- Verify the correct port is being used (check configuration)
- Check for port conflicts (use `netstat -ano` to see all open ports)
- Verify firewall settings are not blocking the connection
- Restart the server with administrator privileges

#### 2. Permission Errors

**Symptoms:**
- Operations fail with "Access Denied" errors
- File operations cannot complete
- Screenshots cannot be taken

**Solutions:**
- Run the command prompt or terminal as administrator
- Check file and directory permissions
- Ensure the user running the server has necessary permissions
- Add explicit permissions for the required directories

#### 3. Tool Not Found Error

**Symptoms:**
- Claude reports "Tool not found" when trying to use a specific capability
- Function calls fail with missing tool errors

**Solutions:**
- Make sure the tool is registered and the server is properly configured
- Check that the server URL is correctly entered in Claude Desktop settings
- Verify the tool implementation in the server code
- Restart the server and Claude Desktop

#### 4. Node.js Package Errors

**Symptoms:**
- NPM servers fail to start
- Package not found errors
- Version compatibility issues

**Solutions:**
- Reinstall the packages with `npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-name`
- Check Node.js version (v14+ recommended)
- Clear NPM cache with `npm cache clean --force`
- Check for version compatibility issues in the package.json files

#### 5. Python Environment Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Import errors when running Python servers
- Missing module errors
- Version conflicts

**Solutions:**
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Create a new virtual environment: `python -m venv .venv`
- Activate the virtual environment before running servers
- Check Python version (3.9+ recommended)

### Log Files and Debugging
