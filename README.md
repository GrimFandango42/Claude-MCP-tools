## 🛠️ Development Guidelines

### Tool Selection Priority
1. **Direct API calls** (filesystem, database operations)
2. **Specialized MCP servers** (domain expertise)
3. **GUI automation** (only when necessary)

### Environment Considerations
- **WSL Users**: Use Windows Python for MCP compatibility
- **Linux Users**: Virtual environments for externally-managed systems
- **Docker Users**: Containerized solutions with proper volume mounting

### Best Practices
- Always run environment detection before complex operations
- Use memory systems for project continuity
- Create comprehensive documentation for new servers
- Implement intelligent fallback strategies
