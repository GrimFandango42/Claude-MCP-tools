# Autonomous Assistant Project Tracker

## Project Overview
Transform Claude into a fully autonomous desktop assistant using modular MCP servers built on the existing Claude-MCP-tools foundation.

## Project Status: **READY TO IMPLEMENT**
- Start Date: 2025-01-24
- Current Phase: Ready for Docker Orchestration MCP Development
- Next Milestone: Complete Docker Orchestration MCP with integrated debugging

## 🔍 DEBUGGING CAPABILITIES CONFIRMED
✅ **Full Debugging Access Available:**
- Claude Desktop configuration: `C:\Users\Nithin\AppData\Roaming\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- MCP server logs: `C:\Users\Nithin\AppData\Roaming\Claude\logs\`
- Real-time error analysis and troubleshooting capabilities
- Can read/write configurations and analyze log files autonomously

## 🚀 CURRENT DEVELOPMENT STATUS

### 🔧 Docker Orchestration MCP - ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT
**Location**: `servers/docker-orchestration-mcp/`
**Progress**: Phase A Complete, Phase B 30% Complete
**Timeline**: Started 2025-01-24, Target 2025-01-27

**Completed Today:**
✅ Complete server infrastructure and MCP protocol implementation
✅ Docker client integration with robust error handling
✅ 5 core container management tools (deploy, list, info, start, stop)
✅ Comprehensive development environment (setup, tests, documentation)
✅ Structured logging and debugging integration
✅ 19 MCP tools registered and framework established

**In Progress:**
🚀 Implementing remaining 14 MCP tools (network, volume, stack management)
🚀 Health monitoring and diagnostics capabilities
🚀 Integration testing with existing N8n server

**Success Test Planned:**
*"Deploy complete web application stack (nginx + postgres + redis) with monitoring"*
→ Expected: Working deployment in <3 minutes

## Implementation Strategy
**Modular Approach**: Build and test one MCP server at a time, ensuring each works independently before integration.

## Foundation Assets (Already Available)
✅ **Existing MCP Servers in `/servers/`:**
- `financial-mcp-server` - Financial data access
- `knowledge-memory-mcp` - Note and knowledge management  
- `windows-computer-use` - Desktop automation (Production Ready)
- `n8n-mcp-server` - Workflow automation capabilities
- `containerized-computer-use` - Isolated computer use (In Development)

✅ **Development Infrastructure:**
- MCP server template with testing framework
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
- Claude Desktop configuration management
- Git integration and version control
