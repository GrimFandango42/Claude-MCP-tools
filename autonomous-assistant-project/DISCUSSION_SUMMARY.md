# Project Management & Knowledge Base Strategy

## Current Discussion Summary (2025-01-24)

### Decision Made: Modular Development Approach
- Build one MCP server at a time
- Test each server independently before integration
- Maintain compatibility with existing servers in C:\AI_Projects\Claude-MCP-tools
- Use existing foundation (financial, knowledge-memory, computer-use, n8n servers)

### Recommended First Server: Docker Orchestration MCP
**Why:** Highest impact, enables autonomous container deployment, foundation for other servers
**Timeline:** 3-4 days development + testing
**Success Test:** Deploy multi-container web application stack with single Claude command

### Project Tracking Strategy Agreed Upon:
1. **File-based tracking** in `autonomous-assistant-project/` directory
2. **Git commits** for version control and change tracking
3. **Structured documentation** using templates and checklists
4. **Knowledge base updates** after each server completion

### Project Structure Created:
```
autonomous-assistant-project/
├── PROJECT_TRACKER.md          # Main project status
├── SERVER_CHECKLIST_TEMPLATE.md # Template for each server
├── TESTING_STRATEGY.md         # Comprehensive testing approach
└── [Future server-specific tracking files]
```

## Knowledge Base Update Strategy

### After Each Server Completion:
1. **Update PROJECT_TRACKER.md** with progress and lessons learned
2. **Create server-specific documentation** using checklist template
3. **Update main README.md** with new capabilities
4. **Commit changes to git** with descriptive commit messages
5. **Update knowledge base** (when fixed) with key insights

### Knowledge Areas to Track:
- **Technical Implementation Details:** What worked, what didn't
- **Integration Patterns:** How servers work together
- **Testing Insights:** Effective testing strategies discovered
- **Performance Learnings:** Optimization techniques
- **User Experience Notes:** What makes autonomous interactions smooth

### Documentation Standards:
- **Clear Success Criteria:** Measurable outcomes for each server
- **Integration Points:** How each server connects to others
- **Troubleshooting Guides:** Common issues and solutions
- **Example Scenarios:** Real-world usage patterns

## Next Actions Agreed Upon:
1. **Start with Docker Orchestration MCP** server development
2. **Use modular approach** with independent testing
3. **Update project tracker** after each milestone
4. **Build incrementally** toward full autonomous capabilities

## Questions Resolved:
- ✅ Project tracking method decided (file-based + git)
- ✅ Implementation order prioritized (Docker first)
- ✅ Testing strategy defined (independent then integrated)
- ✅ Knowledge management approach established

## Outstanding Decisions:
- Final approval to start Docker Orchestration MCP development
- Specific timeline for first server completion
- Integration testing schedule with existing servers
