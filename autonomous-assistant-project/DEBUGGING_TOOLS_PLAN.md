# Autonomous Debugging Tools - Implementation Plan

## ðŸŽ¯ OBJECTIVE
Create specialized debugging tools to enhance our autonomous MCP server development and deployment process.

## ðŸ”§ TOOL 1: MCP Log Analyzer
**Purpose**: Parse and analyze large MCP server log files efficiently
**Priority**: High (needed immediately for debugging)

### Implementation
```python
# mcp-log-analyzer/src/analyzer.py
class MCPLogAnalyzer:
    def read_log_tail(self, log_path: str, lines: int = 100):
        """Read last N lines from large log files"""
        
    def parse_mcp_messages(self, log_content: str):
        """Extract and parse JSON-RPC messages"""
        
    def identify_errors(self, messages: list):
        """Classify and categorize errors"""
        
    def suggest_fixes(self, error_type: str, context: dict):
        """Provide automated fix suggestions"""
```

### Integration Points
- Used by Docker Orchestration MCP for deployment validation
- Called by Master Orchestrator for health monitoring
- Available as standalone debugging tool

## ðŸ”§ TOOL 2: Configuration Validator
**Purpose**: Validate Claude Desktop configuration before deployment
**Priority**: High (prevents deployment failures)

### Implementation
```python
# mcp-config-validator/src/validator.py
class MCPConfigValidator:
    def validate_syntax(self, config: dict):
        """Validate JSON syntax and structure"""
        
    def check_paths(self, config: dict):
        """Verify all file paths exist and are accessible"""
        
    def validate_env_vars(self, config: dict):
        """Check environment variables are set correctly"""
        
    def detect_conflicts(self, config: dict):
        """Identify port conflicts and duplicate servers"""
```

### Integration Points
- Called before any configuration changes
- Used by all MCP servers before self-registration
- Integrated into deployment pipeline

## ðŸ”§ TOOL 3: Health Check Orchestrator
**Purpose**: Systematic health monitoring across all MCP servers
**Priority**: Medium (enhances reliability)

### Implementation
```python
# mcp-health-orchestrator/src/orchestrator.py
class MCPHealthOrchestrator:
    def check_server_health(self, server_name: str):
        """Comprehensive health check for individual server"""
        
    def monitor_all_servers(self):
        """Continuous monitoring of all configured servers"""
        
    def auto_restart_failed(self, server_name: str):
        """Automatically restart failed servers"""
        
    def generate_health_report(self):
        """Create comprehensive system health report"""
```

### Integration Points
- Used by Master Orchestrator for system monitoring
- Called by individual servers for self-health reporting
- Integrated with alert systems

## ðŸ“… IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE

### Week 1: Log Analyzer (With Docker Orchestration MCP)
- **Day 1-2**: Build basic log parsing and tail reading
- **Day 3**: Integrate with Docker Orchestration MCP development
- **Day 4**: Add error classification and suggestions
- **Day 5**: Test with existing server logs

### Week 2: Configuration Validator
- **Day 1-2**: Build syntax and path validation
- **Day 3**: Add environment variable checking
- **Day 4**: Implement conflict detection
- **Day 5**: Integrate with deployment process

### Week 3: Health Check Orchestrator
- **Day 1-2**: Build individual server health checks
- **Day 3**: Implement continuous monitoring
- **Day 4**: Add auto-restart capabilities
- **Day 5**: Create health reporting dashboard

## ðŸ”„ INTEGRATION WITH AUTONOMOUS ASSISTANT

### Docker Orchestration MCP (First Server)
**Debugging Integration:**
- Pre-deployment configuration validation
- Real-time log analysis during container creation
- Health monitoring of deployed containers
- Automatic error recovery and retry logic

### Future Servers
**Progressive Enhancement:**
- Each server gets debugging capabilities by default
- Shared debugging infrastructure across all servers
- Centralized error reporting and resolution
- Autonomous troubleshooting capabilities

## ðŸŽ¯ SUCCESS METRICS

### Log Analyzer
- [ ] Can parse large log files (>1MB) in under 2 seconds
- [ ] Accurately identifies 90%+ of common error types
- [ ] Provides actionable fix suggestions
- [ ] Integrates seamlessly with server development

### Configuration Validator
- [ ] Catches 95%+ of configuration errors before deployment
- [ ] Validates all path and environment variable issues
- [ ] Detects server conflicts and dependencies
- [ ] Provides clear error messages and fixes

### Health Orchestrator
- [ ] Monitors all servers with <1 minute response time
- [ ] Successfully auto-restarts failed servers 90%+ of time
- [ ] Provides real-time health dashboard
- [ ] Generates actionable health reports

## ðŸ”§ DEVELOPMENT APPROACH

### Tool-First Development
1. **Build debugging tool first**
2. **Test with existing servers**
3. **Integrate into new server development**
4. **Enhance based on real-world usage**

### Modular Architecture
- Each tool works independently
- Shared utilities and common functions
- Clean APIs for integration
- Comprehensive testing for each tool

### Progressive Enhancement
- Start with basic functionality
- Add advanced features based on needs
- Integrate feedback from autonomous deployments
- Continuous improvement based on usage patterns
