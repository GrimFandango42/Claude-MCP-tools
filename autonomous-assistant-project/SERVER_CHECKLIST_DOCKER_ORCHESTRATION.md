# Server Development Checklist Template

## Server: Docker Orchestration MCP
**Start Date:** 2025-01-24
**Estimated Completion:** 2025-01-27
**Status:** In Development - Phase A Complete

## Phase A: Planning & Setup âœ…
- [x] Created server directory from template structure
- [x] Defined specific requirements and capabilities (19 MCP tools planned)
- [x] Identified dependencies (Docker Desktop, docker-py, MCP SDK)
- [x] Planned test scenarios and success criteria
- [x] Setup development environment with virtual environment support

## Phase B: Core Development ðŸš§
- [x] Implemented basic MCP server structure with tool registration
- [x] Added Docker client initialization with error handling  
- [x] Created core container management tools (deploy, list, info, start, stop)
- [x] Added comprehensive error handling and logging
- [x] Built configuration validation framework
- [ ] Complete remaining tool implementations (network, volume, stack deployment)
- [ ] Add health monitoring and diagnostics tools
- [ ] Implement debugging and recovery capabilities
- [ ] Performance optimization and resource management

## Phase C: Integration & Documentation ðŸ•’
- [ ] Integration tests with existing servers
- [ ] Verified no conflicts with other servers
- [ ] Updated server README with examples
- [ ] Added to claude_desktop_config.json
- [ ] Validated Claude Desktop integration

## Phase D: Production Validation ðŸ•’
- [ ] End-to-end real-world testing
- [ ] Performance testing under load
- [ ] Error recovery scenario testing
- [ ] User experience validation
- [ ] Updated PROJECT_TRACKER.md

## Integration Points Verified
- [ ] Works with existing financial-mcp-server
- [ ] Works with existing knowledge-memory-mcp
- [ ] Works with existing windows-computer-use
- [x] Planned integration with existing n8n-mcp-server (container deployments from workflows)
- [ ] No conflicts in Claude Desktop configuration

## Success Test Results
**Test:** "Deploy a complete web application stack (nginx + postgres + redis) with monitoring"
**Expected:** Working multi-container deployment with health monitoring in under 3 minutes
**Actual:** [To be tested]
**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ Pending

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Features
- **Server Infrastructure**: MCP protocol implementation with 19 registered tools
- **Docker Client**: Robust connection handling with error recovery
- **Core Container Tools**: Deploy, list, get info, start, stop containers
- **Logging & Debugging**: Structured JSON logging for Claude Desktop integration
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling with meaningful error messages
- **Development Environment**: Complete setup scripts, tests, and documentation

### ðŸš§ In Progress Features  
- **Advanced Container Operations**: Remove, logs, resource management
- **Network Management**: Create networks, connect containers, service discovery
- **Volume Management**: Persistent storage and data management
- **Multi-Container Stacks**: Application deployment with multiple interconnected services
- **Health Monitoring**: Container health checks and system resource monitoring
- **Advanced Diagnostics**: Issue diagnosis and automatic recovery

### ðŸ“‹ Planned Features
- **Configuration Validation**: Pre-deployment validation and conflict detection
- **Deployment History**: Track and manage deployment records
- **Performance Monitoring**: Resource usage tracking and optimization
- **Integration Webhooks**: N8n workflow triggers and notifications

## Technical Decisions Made

### Architecture Choices
- **Async/Await Pattern**: Full async implementation for non-blocking operations
- **Docker SDK**: Using official docker-py library for robust Docker integration
- **Structured Logging**: JSON-formatted logs for easy parsing and debugging
- **Modular Design**: Each tool is independently implemented and testable

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Graceful Degradation**: Server continues operating if individual tools fail
- **Detailed Error Messages**: Rich error information for debugging
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Automatic retry and fallback options
- **Logging Integration**: All errors logged to Claude Desktop logs directory

### Integration Approach
- **N8n Compatibility**: Designed to work seamlessly with existing N8n workflows
- **Non-Disruptive**: No conflicts with existing MCP servers
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new tools and capabilities
- **Debugging-First**: Built-in debugging capabilities from the start

## Lessons Learned

### Development Insights
- **Docker Connection**: Proper error handling for Docker unavailability is crucial
- **MCP Tool Registration**: Tool schema definition is critical for Claude integration
- **Async Implementation**: Python asyncio requires careful handling of blocking operations
- **Logging Strategy**: Structured logging makes debugging much easier

### Testing Discoveries
- **Docker Dependency**: All tests must handle Docker availability gracefully
- **Mock Strategy**: Comprehensive mocking needed for CI/CD environments
- **Integration Testing**: Real Docker tests vs mocked tests both necessary
- **Performance**: Container operations can be slow, need proper timeout handling

## Next Steps (Phase B Completion)
- [ ] Complete remaining MCP tool implementations (12 tools remaining)
- [ ] Add comprehensive error recovery and rollback mechanisms
- [ ] Implement health monitoring dashboard capabilities
- [ ] Create application stack deployment templates
- [ ] Performance optimization and resource monitoring
- [ ] Integration testing with N8n server workflows

## Deployment Preparation
- [ ] Create Claude Desktop configuration template
- [ ] Write integration guide for existing server compatibility
- [ ] Document troubleshooting procedures
- [ ] Create example usage scenarios and workflows
