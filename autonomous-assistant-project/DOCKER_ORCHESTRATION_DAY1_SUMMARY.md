- `list_containers()` - List containers with filtering capabilities
- `get_container_info()` - Detailed container information and statistics
- `stop_container()` - Graceful container shutdown
- `start_container()` - Container startup management

### ✅ **Debugging & Monitoring Integration**
- **Structured Logging**: JSON-formatted logs for Claude Desktop integration
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling with recovery
- **Performance Tracking**: Deployment history and timing information
- **Health Integration**: Framework for health monitoring and diagnostics

### ✅ **Testing & Validation Framework**
- **Comprehensive Tests**: Unit tests, integration tests, and Docker connectivity tests
- **Automated Setup**: One-click environment setup with `setup.bat`
- **Test Runner**: Quick validation with `test.bat` script
- **Development Tools**: Complete toolchain for development and debugging

### ✅ **Documentation & Project Management**
- **Detailed README**: Complete documentation with usage examples
- **Server Checklist**: Detailed progress tracking with phase management
- **Project Integration**: Updated main project tracker with current status
- **Claude Desktop Config**: Ready-to-use configuration template

## 🚀 **Current Status: Phase A Complete, Phase B 30% Complete**

### **What's Working Right Now**
```python
# These operations are fully implemented and tested:
- Deploy any Docker container with custom configuration
- List and filter containers across the system
- Get detailed container information and resource usage
- Start and stop containers with proper error handling
- Full logging and debugging integration with Claude Desktop
```

### **In Development (Phase B - 70% Remaining)**
```python
# These operations are registered but need implementation:
- remove_container() - Safe container removal
- get_container_logs() - Log retrieval and analysis  
- create_network() - Network management
- create_volume() - Persistent storage
- deploy_application_stack() - Multi-container applications
- health_monitoring() - Advanced diagnostics
- configuration_validation() - Pre-deployment checks
```

## 📋 **Next Development Session (Day 2-3)**

### **Priority 1: Complete Core Container Operations**
- [ ] Implement `remove_container()` with safety checks
- [ ] Add `get_container_logs()` with tail and follow options
- [ ] Complete error recovery and rollback mechanisms
- [ ] Add resource management and limits

### **Priority 2: Network & Volume Management**
- [ ] Implement `create_network()` and network connectivity
- [ ] Add `create_volume()` and persistent storage management
- [ ] Enable container-to-container communication
- [ ] Service discovery basics

### **Priority 3: Multi-Container Applications**
- [ ] Implement `deploy_application_stack()` for complex deployments
- [ ] Add application health monitoring
- [ ] Create deployment templates (web+db, microservices, etc.)
- [ ] Integration with N8n workflows

## 🎯 **Success Milestone Target**

**End of Week Goal:**
```bash
Command: "Deploy a complete web application stack with database and monitoring"
Expected Result: 
├── nginx web server (port 80 → 8080)
├── postgres database (with persistent storage)  
├── redis cache (for sessions)
├── custom network (app-network)
├── health monitoring (container status checks)
└── deployment completed in < 3 minutes
```

## 🔧 **Technical Architecture Highlights**

### **Async-First Design**
```python
# All operations are async for non-blocking execution
async def _deploy_container(self, image: str, **config):
    # Non-blocking Docker operations
    # Proper error handling and recovery
    # Structured response format
```

### **Robust Error Handling**
```python
# Every operation includes comprehensive error handling
try:
    result = await docker_operation()
    return {"success": True, "data": result}
except docker.errors.NotFound:
    return {"success": False, "error": "Resource not found"}
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
    return {"success": False, "error": str(e)}
```

### **Integration-Ready**
```python
# Designed for seamless integration with existing servers
# N8n workflow compatibility
# Knowledge memory integration for deployment history
# Computer use integration for GUI operations when needed
```

## 📈 **Progress Metrics**

### **Development Velocity**
- **Day 1**: 19 tools registered, 5 core tools implemented (26% complete)
- **Estimated Day 2**: 12 additional tools implemented (90% complete)
- **Estimated Day 3**: Integration testing and deployment (100% complete)

### **Code Quality**
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling across all operations
- **Logging**: Structured JSON logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, and Docker connectivity validation
- **Documentation**: Complete README, setup guides, and usage examples

### **Integration Readiness**
- **MCP Protocol**: Full compliance with Model Context Protocol standards
- **Claude Desktop**: Ready for configuration with provided template
- **Existing Servers**: Designed for compatibility with all existing MCP servers
- **N8n Workflows**: Planned integration points for workflow automation

## 🔮 **Tomorrow's Plan**

### **Session Goals (Day 2)**
1. **Complete remaining 12 core tools** (4-5 hours)
2. **Add multi-container stack deployment** (2-3 hours) 
3. **Integration testing with N8n server** (1-2 hours)
4. **Claude Desktop configuration and testing** (1 hour)

### **Expected Outcomes**
- **Fully functional Docker orchestration server** with all 19 tools implemented
- **Multi-container application deployment** capability
- **Integration with existing N8n workflows** for automated deployments
- **Production-ready configuration** for Claude Desktop

## 🏆 **Foundation for Autonomous Assistant**

This Docker Orchestration MCP server serves as the **infrastructure foundation** for the autonomous assistant:

- **Container Deployment**: Autonomous infrastructure provisioning
- **N8n Integration**: Workflow-triggered deployments
- **Health Monitoring**: Self-healing infrastructure
- **Service Discovery**: Dynamic application networking
- **Resource Management**: Intelligent resource allocation

**Next Servers Will Build On This:**
