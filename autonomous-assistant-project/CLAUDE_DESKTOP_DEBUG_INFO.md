# Claude Desktop Configuration & Debugging - Critical System Info

## Configuration Location
**Claude Desktop Config File:** `C:\Users\Nithin\AppData\Roaming\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- This is where all MCP server configurations are stored
- Changes require Claude Desktop restart to take effect
- Critical for autonomous MCP server deployment

## Logging & Debugging Location  
**Error Logs Directory:** `C:\Users\Nithin\AppData\Roaming\Claude\logs\`
- Contains individual MCP server logs
- Pattern: `mcp-server-<servername>.log`
- Contains general MCP system logs: `mcp.log`
- Essential for autonomous error detection and resolution

## Autonomous Debugging Capabilities
- Can read configuration files to verify MCP server setup
- Can analyze error logs to identify and fix issues
- Can modify configurations to resolve problems
- Can validate MCP server status and connectivity

## Integration with Autonomous Assistant
This information enables:
1. **Self-Healing**: Detect and fix MCP server issues automatically
2. **Autonomous Deployment**: Verify configurations after deployment
3. **Proactive Monitoring**: Check logs for early warning signs
4. **Dynamic Configuration**: Modify settings based on requirements

## Testing Current Debugging Capabilities
- [ ] Test reading Claude Desktop configuration file
- [ ] Test analyzing error logs in logs directory
- [ ] Test modifying configuration file
- [ ] Identify gaps in debugging tools
- [ ] Plan creation of specialized debugging MCP server if needed
