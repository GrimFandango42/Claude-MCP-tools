## 🛠️ **Technical Requirements**

### **Computer Use API Compatibility**
```python
# Required tool implementations
tools = [
    "computer_20241022",      # Screenshot + click/type/key
    "text_editor_20241022",   # File editing (Windows + WSL)
    "bash_20241022"          # WSL command execution
]
```

### **WSL Environment Setup**
```bash
# Required WSL components
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y bash git python3 python3-pip nodejs npm curl wget
curl -fsSL https://cursor.sh/install | sh  # Claude Code installation
```

### **VS Code Configuration**
```json
// Required VS Code extensions
{
    "recommendations": [
        "ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl",
        "ms-python.python",
        "bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss",
        "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
    ]
}
```

## 🧪 **Testing Strategy**

### **Unit Tests**
